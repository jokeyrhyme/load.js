# loadJS (ex-RequireJS)

simple script loader based on extracted logic from RequireJS

## Why?

[loadJS](https://github.com/filamentgroup/loadJS) inspired me, but I needed
something a little bit more comprehensive.

Heaps of great script-loading research is evident in
[RequireJS](https://github.com/jrburke/requirejs), so it made sense to start
from there.
