# loadJS (ex-RequireJS) [![npm module](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@jokeyrhyme/load.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jokeyrhyme/load) [![Travis CI Status](https://travis-ci.org/jokeyrhyme/load.js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jokeyrhyme/load.js)

simple script loader based on extracted logic from RequireJS


## Why?

[loadJS](https://github.com/filamentgroup/loadJS) inspired me, but I needed
something a little bit more comprehensive.

Heaps of great script-loading research is evident in
[RequireJS](https://github.com/jrburke/requirejs), so it made sense to start
from there.
